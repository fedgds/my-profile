   Four hard statuses, each gating a DIFFERENT action, so they are not

     stun     no casting, no basic attack, no movement   (shortest)
     freeze   no casting, no movement — basics still land, and the
              target takes amplified damage while frozen
     silence  no casting — basics and movement continue  (longest)
     root     no movement — casting and basics continue

   DIMINISHING RETURNS is the whole reason this is safe to ship. Each
   application of the same category on the same target within the
   memory window lands at a fraction of its printed duration, and past
   the third it does nothing at all. Without it two CC skills chain
   into a permanent lock: the headless harness put an unbounded
   double-CC build at 96% before this existed, and 51% after.

   an over-rewarding upgrade and k>1 steepens a weak one.

   Why it is off: a uniform-LV3 measurement says utility upgrades
   over-deliver (+15.6pt LV1->LV3) and rider upgrades under-deliver
   (-10.3pt), and fitting k against that does flatten those curves. But
   that regime is an artefact of the test, not the game -- only 3% of
   drafted skills ever reach LV3, and a lone LV3 among LV1 fillers wins
   98-100% of the time for every skill, so the measurement is saturated
   and cannot discriminate. Applying the fitted k made the metric that
   matches real play WORSE: paired A/B outliers 0/40 -> 7/40, real-draft
   outliers 0/40 -> 3/40. So the numbers were fitted to noise and are
   discarded. The knob stays because the analysis is sound and a future

/* MEASURED, NOT FIXED — why upgrades are not equally good for everyone.
   LV3 fights run ~2.2x shorter than LV1 (27s -> 12s), and the LV1->LV3
   win-rate slope splits by category, not by mechanic:
       utility (pure % multipliers)   +15.6pt
       damage carrying a rider        -10.3pt
       damage with no rider           +0.2pt
   correlations: isUtility +0.52, hasRider -0.38 (among damage skills).
   A percentage multiplier compounds against a build that already tripled,
   so tripling it again over-delivers; a rider skill paid for its rider
   with a base-damage discount, so upgrading inflates exactly the part it
   underpaid.
   Left uncorrected on purpose: see `k` above. Correcting it optimises a
   regime real drafts barely produce (3% of skills reach LV3) and made
   both realistic metrics worse. Not fixed by touching the DoT mechanic
   either -- two attempts tried that and measurement refuted it: a DoT is
   2-7% of damage dealt and its share RISES with level. */

     Blood Pact  pact  wants 1.36 at LV2 (+13%) and 2.25 at LV3 (+88%) vs 1.20
     Stone Skin  dr    wants 0.61 at LV3 (+11%) vs 0.55
   so part of those upgrades is wasted. Two cures were tried and both cost
   more than the bug: flattening the utility curve nerfed all 15 utility
   skills and sank the defensives, and cap-deriving the base made LV1 25-40%
   weaker in 100% of draws to recover overflow that occurs in a few percent.

   It is also self-correcting in a way worth stating: because the balance
   fit measures what a skill DELIVERS, not what it requests, these three
   are priced as the clamped values they actually produce -- all three sit
   within noise of 50% in the paired A/B. The waste is real but it is
   already paid for, and only 3% of drafted skills ever reach LV3.        */

/* ---------- skill catalog ----------

   The 4-decimal role/u values are SOLVED, not typed. They come from a
   paired A/B: both sides draft the same filler build, one contested slot
   differs by a same-tier peer, seats swapped so seat effects cancel. 50%
   is then correct by construction, and each coefficient is driven to it
   by coordinate descent (9 passes, ~24k battles per verification).

   This replaced an earlier fit made against per-skill win rates from real
   drafts, which was measuring the DRAFTER: holding a strong skill
   correlates with having drafted well, and the stronger build wins 81% of
   non-tied drafts. Under that biased target, damage skills sat at 53.1%
   and utility at 40.4% -- a 12.7pt gap that looked like ten separate
   balance bugs. Refitting against the unbiased target closed it to
   50.0/50.1 and took within-tier outliers from 18/40 to 1/40 (paired A/B)
   and 6/40 to 0/40 (real drafts). Blood Pact alone moved 28.1% -> 50.3%.

/* ── COMBO BONUSES ──────────────────────────────────────────────
   Every bonus is a PERCENTAGE MULTIPLIER on something the build
   already does, never flat damage. That matters for balance: a
   multiplier scales with what you drafted, so a combo cannot make a
   weak build strong on its own, and it does not need its own solved
   coefficient the way a damage skill does.

   Magnitudes are deliberately small (5–18% for pairs). Two same-family
   skills is a cheap thing to stumble into; three is a real draft
   commitment and pays roughly double. They are also symmetric — both
   fighters can build them, and the A/B harness drafts the same filler
   on both sides, so combos largely cancel in the balance fit rather
   than invalidating it.
   `vfx` is the visual power multiplier: combo-active skills render
   bigger, which is the readable feedback that the combo is live.    */
